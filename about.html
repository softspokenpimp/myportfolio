            <h2> About Sierra </h2>
            <p>
                Sierra Bounds was born in La Paz, Bolivia. She was adopted at 10 months
                and moved to Texas. She is not shy about her adoption, because her parents
                never kept it a secret. Due to being adopted so young, she does not remember
                anything about being in the orphanage. Feel free to ask any questions!</p>
            <p> Sierra went to Lamar University and graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical
                Engineering. Currently she works as a Construction Manager at a Chemical Plant.
                While Sierra enjoys her work, she want to shift her career and be in the tech
                world. So she signed up for the Coding Temple Bootcamp and hopes to enroll in 
                a Software Engineering Masters program in the next year. </p>
            <p> In her free time, Sierra enjoys spoiling her dog, Lizzie Bounds. Lizzie is 5
                pounds of energy. She is a Yorkshire Terrier, so she thinks her cuteness 
                pays the bills. Sierra also enjoys watching various movies, as mentioned on 
                the homepage, and reading. See below for some book recomedations. </p>
            <p> Thank you for visiting Sierra's website!
